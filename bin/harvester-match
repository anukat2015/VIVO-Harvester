#update memory to match your hardware -- set both to be the same, in general the more memory the better, but too much can cause errors as well.
#8G-12G on large vivo's seems to work well
#MIN_MEM=2g
#MAX_MEM=8g

MIN_MEM=1g
MAX_MEM=1g
#Variable for optimizations to the Java virtual machine.
#-server                                                Run in server mode, which takes longer to start but runs faster
#-d64                                                   Use 64-bit JVM
#-XX:+UseParallelOldGC                  Use high throughput parallel GC on old generation 
#-XX:+DisableExplicitGC                 Prevent direct calls to garbage collection in the code
#-XX:+UseAdaptiveGCBoundary             Allow young/old boundary to move
#-XX:-UseGCOverheadLimit                Limit the amount of time that Java will stay in Garbage Collection before throwing an out of memory exception
#-XX:SurvivorRatio=16                   Shrink eden slightly (Normal is 25)
#-Xnoclassgc                                    Disable collection of class objects
#-XX:ParallelGCThreads=3                Maximum number of Parallel garbage collection tasks
