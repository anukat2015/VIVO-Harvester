Part 1
=========

You need to modify certains files to ingest the data from the example csv file course_data.csv.

Here are the files that need to be modified:

1. vivo.model.xml

check that the database information is configured correctly for your system

2. run-d2rmap-csv.sh

set to the directory where the harvester was installed
HARVESTER_INSTALL_DIR

3. remove-last-d2rmap-csv-harvest.sh

set to the directory where the harvester was installed
HARVESTER_INSTALL_DIR

4. d2rmap-csv-fetch.config.xml

set to the correct path for "d2rMapWorkingDirectory"

5. all the changenamespace-*.config.xml files

change the "newNamespace" value to the namespace of your VIVO instance
