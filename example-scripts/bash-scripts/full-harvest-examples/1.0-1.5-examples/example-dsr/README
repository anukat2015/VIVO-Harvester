You need to modify certains files to ingest data using this example.

Here are the files that need to be modified:

1. vivo.model.xml

check that the database information is configured correctly for your system

2. run-dsr.sh

set to the directory where the harvester was installed
HARVESTER_INSTALL_DIR
(Note: there are several other shell scripts which also will need to modified)

3. jdbcfetch.config.xml

change the database connection parameters to your database instance

5. all the changenamespace-*.config.xml files

change the "newNamespace" value to the namespace of your VIVO instance
