You need to modify certains files to ingest data using this example.

Here are the files that need to be modified:

1. vivo.model.xml

check that the database information is configured correctly for your system.  By default, it will
connect to a database called vitrodb_test on localhost

2. run-d2rmap.sh

set to the directory where the harvester was installed
HARVESTER_INSTALL_DIR
(Note: there may be other shell scripts which have a set HARVESTER_INSTALL_DIR which
will need to modified)

3. databasecone.config.xml

change the database connection parameters to your database instance.  The example includes a demodb.sql file which can be used to instantiate a test database using MySQL

5. all the changenamespace-*.config.xml files

change the "newNamespace" value to the namespace of your VIVO instance
