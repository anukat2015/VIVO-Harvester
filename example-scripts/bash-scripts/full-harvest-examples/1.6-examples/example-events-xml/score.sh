# Execute Event Scoring and Matching
# In the scoring phase the data in the harvest is compared to the data within Vivo and a new model
# 	is created with the values / scores of the data comparisons.
# We execute scores in 2 different steps, known as "tiered scoring". The initial score limits our input set to speed up performance 
harvester-score -X score-events.config.xml

# Find matches using scores and rename nodes to matching uri
# Using the data model created by the score phase, the match process changes the harvested uris for
# 	comparison values above the chosen threshold within the xml configuration file.
harvester-match -X match-events.config.xml
