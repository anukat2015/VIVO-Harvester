<% When working with jena models this tool allows uniform access with them. The RecordHandler formatted data can      %>
<%     be loaded into a model. A SPARQL query can be run from the command-line using this tool.                       %>

<%  wordiness - (optional) sets the lowest level of log messages to be displayed to the console.  The lower the log   %>
