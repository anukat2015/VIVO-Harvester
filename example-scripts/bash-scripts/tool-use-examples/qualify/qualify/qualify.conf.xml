<%  ===== Qualify =====                                                                                               %>
<%  The purpose of this tools is to allow batch changes to be applied to data within a jena model.                    %>
<%  ===== Reason for Use =====                                                                                        %>
<%  When there are sections of data that need to be removed or changed then the qualify tool is a way of performing   %>
<%    those changes without the need to know how to form the sparql update queries.                                   %>
<%                                                                                                                    %>

<%  wordiness - (optional) sets the lowest level of log messages to be displayed to the console.  The lower the log   %>
<%          level, the more detailed the messages.                                                                    %>

<%          <Param name="wordiness">INFO</Param> - (Default) Results in all messages above and including INFO level   %>
<%              messages to be displayed. INFO level messages detail when the tool has started and ended and when it  %>

<%              been found.                                                                                           %>
<%          <Param name="wordiness">DEBUG</Param> - Results in all messages above and including DEBUG level messages  %>

<%              TRACE level messages details every matching set as it is processed in each phase along with SPARQL    %>
<%              queries and start and stop for their execution.                                                       %>
